# fac30_webApi_workshop
record for the web api developed as a dotnet workshop for FAC30

## Expectations

This workshop is a loosely-structured collaborative exercise. All participants are encouraged to take notes in any format that suits them and code along their own version of the codebase (with as many inventive changes as they find interesting) - This code base will be updated throughout and kept public for future consultation.

If you are coding along you may want to fork this repo at the end to allow for further exploration. Up to you ðŸ˜Š

### Technical Targets

We'll definitely:
- Create an in-memory database and seed it with data
- Create a basic controller to allow us to perform CRUD operations
- Add unit tests to for our endpoints

We'll probably:
- Explore and apply the principle of dependency inversion to loosely couple different parts of our code
- Apply the Data Transfer Object pattern to separate our contract with the client from our internal architecture

We'll maybe:
- Set up a CORS policy
- Serve our webApi to a bespoke frontend (either with a JS Framework or Blazer Pages)

We'll hopefully:
- Understand everything we did

The workshop ends when we run out of time, motivation or interest.

Try to have fun âœ¨
